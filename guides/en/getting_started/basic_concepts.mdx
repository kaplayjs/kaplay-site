# Basic Concepts

To get started with KAPLAY, you must know 4 main concepts: **Scenes**, **Game
Objects**, **Components** and **Events**.

You can think of your game as a **_theater_**: **scenes** are the acts, **game objects** are
the actors, and **components** are the script the actors follow:

## Game Initialization

All KAPLAY games start with the `kaplay()` function. This function makes
available all methods and functions that you will use to create your game.

<Code code="kaplay();" />

You can also pass an object with `KAPLAYOpt`:

```js
kaplay({
    width: 640,
    height: 480,
    background: "#00ff00",
    scale: 2,
    canvas: document.getElementById("canvas"),
    // other options...
});
```

## Game Objects

The **game object** is the basic unit of KAPLAY. The player, an enemy or a bean are all game objects, they are our actors. They
move, interact, and make the game interesting.

You can create objects with the `add()` function, which takes an array of
**components** and **tags**. The **components** define the object's behavior while **tags** classify it in some way:

```js
const obj = add([
    // this is a component that draws a rectangle
    rect(32, 32),
    // I can classify it as a shape
    "shape",
]);
```

We go in depth with game objects in the [**Game Objects**](/docs/guides/game_objects)
guide.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of game objects. They define the behavior of
the object, like how it moves, looks, and interacts with other objects.

In KAPLAY, there are many built-in components that you can use to create your
game objects. For example:

- `pos(x, y)` sets the position of the object.
- `rect(width, height)` draws a rectangle.
- `color(r, g, b)` sets the color of the object.

We go in depth with components in the [**Components**](/docs/guides/components)
guide.

## Scenes

Scenes are what wrap the game objects -- the acts of the stageplay. Typical
scenes might include a main menu, the game itself, and a game over screen.

In KAPLAY, you create scenes with the `scene()` function:

```js
kaplay(); // remember to initialize the game

scene("game", () => {
    const rect = add([
        // a component
        rect(32, 32),
    ]);
});
```

We go in depth with scenes on the [**Scenes**](/docs/guides/scenes) guide.

## Events

Events are specific moments of your game execution that you can handle and
execute code when that happens.

```js
onUpdate(() => {
    // this code is executed every frame (normally 60 times per second)
});

onKeyPress("space", () => {
    // this code is executed only when the space key is pressed
});
```

We go in depth with events on the [**Events**](/docs/guides/events) guide.
