# Components

A component is a piece of code that defines a specific behavior of a game
object. It returns a set of **properties** and **methods** that are attached to
the game object.

## Using a component

To use components, we have to attach them in the `add()` function.

```js
const player = add([
    // rect(width, height) comp draws a rectangle in the obj
    rect(40, 60),
    // pos(x, y) comp sets the obj position
    pos(10, 10),
]);

// method given by pos() comp
player.move(100, 0); // moves the player 100px to the right
// property given by rect() comp
debug.log(player.height); // will log 60
```

There are a lot of useful components in KAPLAY like:

- [`sprite()`](/docs/api/ctx/sprite) to make the object draw an image, and play
  animations
- [`area()`](/docs/api/ctx/area) to make the object do collision detection, with
  methods like [`onCollide()`](/docs/api/AreaComp#AreaComp-onCollide)
- [`text()`](/docs/api/ctx/text) to make the object draw text
- [`scale()`](/docs/api/ctx/scale) to make the game object bigger or smaller or to
  stretch it

You can see all the components in the [API Reference](/docs/api/ctx/pos).

## Component operations

All components have an _id_, this is the **name** of the component, `sprite()`'s
id is `"sprite"`. This is used in many operations.

### How to add components

```js
loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png");

// Add the component on creation
const bean = add([
    sprite("bean"), // bean the frog :D
    opacity(0.6), // a ghost bean???
]);

// Add the component after creation
bean.use(color("#ff00ff")); // green bean <:
```

### How to remove components

```js
// We pass the component id to remove it
bean.unuse("sprite"); // bye bean
```

### How to know if a game object has a component

```js
// We pass the component id:
bean.has("sprite"); // false - true if comp is there, otherwise false
```

<Info crew="gun" title="Important!">
Do note that you can't pass the component itself to `.unuse()` / `.has()`.
You have to pass the component _name_!
</Info>

## Making your own components

If you are creating a larger game, it's probably a good idea to bundle some of
your game's functionality into custom components. You can check out how to do
that in [this guide](/docs/guides/custom_components/).
