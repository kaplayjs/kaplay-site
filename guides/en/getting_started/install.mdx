# Installation

<Info crew="bean" title="Basic Knowledge">
If you're new to the **JavaScript World** and you don't know what a _node_ is,
what a _bundler_ is, or what to do with your life in general,
check our [Basic Knowledge Guide](/docs/guides/knowledge).
</Info>

## Recommended Installation

Once you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed, the easiest way to get started with **KAPLAY** is to use
[`our installation package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-kaplay), which
will generate a project for you using the **recommended** structure.

```sh
npx create-kaplay myGame && cd myGame
```

Then, using `npm run dev` you can start the **development server**, where you can test your game locally at [`https://localhost:5173`](https://localhost:5173).

```sh
npm run dev
```

That's it! You're ready to **start making games**. If you want to know all the options available
in the `create-kaplay` package, run `npx create-kaplay --help`.

## Zero Bundlers Installation

If you prefer to use **KAPLAY** **without any bundlers**, you can! Start with
an `index.html` file:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Game</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

<Info crew="kat" title="Serve your statics!">
For using the CDN and HTML correctly, you can't just open the `index.html`, you need
to serve your files. Run `http-server`:

```sh
npm install --global http-server
```

```sh
http-server # Serve your files!
```

</Info>

Now, for using KAPLAY library with a CDN, we have **2 methods**:

### Method 1: JavaScript Modules (Recommended)

You can import KAPLAY using JavaScript modules. **This is the recommended method.**
Create a `main.js` script file and connect it to your `index.html`:

```html
<body>
  <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
</body>
```

Then, import the KAPLAY library inside `index.html`:

<InstallationCode mode="module" />

### Method 2: Legacy JavaScript

Create a `main.js` script file. Connect both `main.js` and KAPLAY library into your
`index.html`:

<InstallationCode mode="script_tag" />

## Custom Node.js Installation

So, you're a pro? Let's get into creating our own template using Node.js. First,
we need to install KAPLAY library in a fresh folder:

```sh
npm install kaplay
```

You'll need to use a bundler to use KAPLAY with NPM. There's a lot of options
like `esbuild`, `webpack`, `parcel`, `vite`, etc. This is a short example using [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/).

```sh
npm install esbuild
```

Once you have `esbuild` installed, and you have this in a `.js` or `.ts` file:

```js
import kaplay from "kaplay";

kaplay();
```

just run

```sh
esbuild game.js --bundle > build.js
```

and it'll find the KAPLAY package and include it in the built `build.js`,
include `build.js` in your HTML and you're good to go. Feel free to automate
this process.
