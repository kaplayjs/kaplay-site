# TypeScript Advanced Features

The TypeScript Advanced Features (a.k.a TAF) are a series of options that can help to TypeScript developers to wrote stronger code and get a better autocomplete.

## Using TypeScript Advanced Features

You can enable TAF using the `KAPLAYOpt.types` property, which you've to pass a `kaplayTypes()` call:

```js
import { kaplay, kaplayTypes } from "kaplay";

const k = kaplay({
    types: kaplayTypes<Opt<{
        // TypeScript Options here
    }>>();
}); 
```

## Typing Scenes

When typing scenes, you can use `TypesOpt.scenes`, where you define scene names and arguments they receive, using a Tuple object:

```ts
import { kaplay, kaplayTypes } from "kaplay";

const k = kaplay({
    types: kaplayTypes<Opt<{
        scenes: {
            // Scene "game" receives a string as first param
	        "game": [playerName: string] // or just [string]
        }
    }>>();
});

k.scene("game", (playerName) => {
	// playerName is typed as "string"
}):

// Autocomplete will suggest "game"
k.go("game", 20); // Error [TODO]
```
