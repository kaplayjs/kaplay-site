# v3001 to v4000 Migration

<Info crew="gun" title="Important!">
This guide is currently based on `master` KAPLAY version (the one that match the last GitHub commit), it's version we recommend
for all developers trying out v4000!
</Info>

## Removed: `make()`

`make()` is an internal function that KAPLAY uses for creating the `GameObjRaw` interface
without adding it to the tree. If you was using it, it was for one of these 2 reasons:

1. If you were using it for prefab-like factory functions, **like this:**

```js
// BEFORE
const makeCar = (centered) => {
    const obj = make([sprite("car")]);

    if (centered) {
        obj.use(pos(center()));
    }

    return obj;
};

const car1 = add(makeCar());
const car2 = add(makeCar(true));
```

```js
// NOW
const car = add([sprite("car")]);
const carPrefab = createPrefab("car", car);

const car1 = addPrefab("car");
const ca2 = addPrefab("car", [
    pos(center()),
]);
```

Check the [Prefab guide](/guides/prefabs) for more information.

2. If you were using it for "modifying" the object before its "creation", **like this:**

```js
// BEFORE
const obj = make([sprite("bean")]);

obj.sprite = "mark";

add(obj);
```
