# v3001 to v4000 Migration

KAPLAY v4000 is the next-generation KAPLAY version. Unlike v3001, KAPLAY v4000
is focused on features/stability over compatibility, that's why if you're
migrating a game, you have to take all the incompatibilities.

<Info crew="gun" title="Important!">
Some of this information may be based on `master` KAPLAY version (the one that match the last GitHub commit), it's version we recommend
for all developers trying out v4000!

## Removed: `make()`
