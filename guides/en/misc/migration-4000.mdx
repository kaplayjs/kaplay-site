# v3001 to v4000 Migration

<Info crew="gun" title="Important!">
This guide is currently based on `master` KAPLAY version (the one that match the last GitHub commit), it's version we recommend
for all developers trying out v4000!
</Info>

## Removed: `make()`

`make()` is an internal function that KAPLAY uses for creating the `GameObjRaw` interface
without adding it to the tree. If you was using it, it was for one of these 2 reasons:

1. If you were using it for prefab-like factory functions, **like this:**

```js
// BEFORE
const makeEnemy = (x = 100, y = 100) => {
    const obj = make([
        sprite("alien"),
        pos(x, y),
    ]);

    return obj;
};

const car1 = add(makeEnemy()); // (100, 100)
const car2 = add(makeEnemy(400, 200)); // (400, 200)
```

```js
// NOW
const enemy = add([sprite("alien")]);
const enemyPrefab = createPrefab("enemy", enemy);

const enemy1 = addPrefab("enemy"); // (100, 100)
const enemy2 = addPrefab("enemy", [pos(400, 200)]); // (400, 200)
```

Check the [Prefab guide](/guides/prefabs) for more information.

1. If you were using it for "modifying" the object before its "creation", **like this:**

```js
// BEFORE
const obj = make([sprite("bean")]);

obj.sprite = "mark";

add(obj);
```
