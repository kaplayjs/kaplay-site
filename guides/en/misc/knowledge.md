# Basic Knowledge

Congratulations! If you're here it is because you want to know the background of
the tools you will be using, that's great. Let's do it as short as possible.

### JavaScript

It's the programming language you will use for create your game. It is mean to be
executed in a browser.

### Node.js

Node.js lets you **execute JavaScript locally** (without the necessity of a browser)
and it's used for performing building and developments tasks.

### Bundler

A bundler is a **building** tool that converts your development JavaScript/TypeScript
in acceptable code for be executed in a Browser. There's a lot of bundlers like
ESBuild, Webpack and Vite.
