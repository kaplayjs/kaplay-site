# Creating Guides

<Info crew="mark" title="Advice">
This guide tries to be brief so you can start as soon as possible, so I won't go into too much detail about why. Some of the guides that are on our documentation **still doesn't follow these guidelines** so it's also cool check some for updating them.
</Info>

Hey! Before starting, let's stand this guide is just for the one wondering to
contribute with **KAPLAY Docs**, specifically the **guides** part. Thanks for your interest on improving **KAPLAY** â™¥

## Get the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay-site.git
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Then, when you finish, just [Open a PR](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/).

## Guidelines

### Communication

The most important thing for creating a guide is the communication with KAPLAY
Dev internals, you can use the [#dev](https://discord.com/channels/883781994583056384/883782527809122367) channel,
telling us what guide are you updating (so no other dev interfers with that) or any other question/blocker you got.

### Creating your guide

After cloning the repo, go to  `/guides/en/` and create in any of the category
folders an `.mdx` file, for example `/guides/en/concepts/anchor.mdx`.

This is the frontmatter used in all guides:

```yml
---
title: Creating Guides # The title, it appears in the sidebar
description: You shouldn't see this # Description for metadata
version: "4000" # "Don't use it unless the guide is only for v4000"
url: contributor-guide-on-guides # The url
order: "misc-4" # The order string, just follow the others in the same category
hidden: true # Hide it
noads: true # Disable ads (used in Contributors pages)
---
```

You can know available categories just looking the folders inside `/guides/` or `/guides/data.json`.

### Writing style

There's little things you've to take in account in the writing style

- **Main Title** should be the same than frontmatter `title`.
- Talk to the user as **you**. Instead of "we can use `get()` for..." do "you can use `get()`" for
- Try to do descriptive titles, instead of **Introduction** -> **How to X** / **Creating X**

#### How to sections

Some guides may include a **How to** section, we could stand this format:

```mdx
# How to [thing]

You can [thing] with [thing they can use]
```

## Components and features in Markdown

There's some special components and markdown features you must know for creating a great
quality document piece.

### Info component

```jsx
import Info from "@/components/Content/Info.astro";

<Info crew="mark" title="oh!">

import Code from "@/components/Content/CodeWithKAPLAYGROUND.astro";

<Code
    code={`
// Code to be rendered
    `}
    pgCode={`
// Code to be played
    `}
/>
```

#### Props

| Prop                        | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code`: `string`            | The JavaScript code to be rendered.                                                                                            |
| `pgCode?`: `string`         | The JavaScript code to be played in KAPLAYGROUND, if there's not, `code` is used                                               |
| `addKAPLAYCall?`: `boolean` | If no `pgCode`, it will use `code` inserting `kaplay()` in the start                                                           |
| `loadCrew`: `string[]`      | Load sprites from crew in the start of the example. Just works if `addKAPLAYCall` is true, and just work with sprites for now. |

<Code
    code={`
// Code to be rendered
    `}
    pgCode={`
// Code to be played
    `}
/>

### Type Links

You can easily link to types writing them between backticks (`):

```mdx
You can use `get(*)` for getting all objects. There's also `GameObjRaw.get()`. 
It doesn't matter the content between (), it will be ignored for generating the link.
```

#### Rendered

You can use `get()` for getting all objects. There's also `GameObjRaw.get()`.

### Special alias for Type Links

You can use convenient alias like `obj` for refer to `GameObjRaw`, there's the
table with all special aliases and features around this:

| This                  | Refers to      | Works in                                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| obj                   | `GameObjRaw`   | Referring to `GameObjRaw` members like `obj.press()`                        |
