# Creating Guides

<Info crew="mark" title="Advice">
This guide tries to be brief so you can start as soon as possible, so I won't go into too much detail about the whys and wherefores. Some of the guides that are on our documentation **still doesn't follow these guidelines** so it's also cool check some for updating them, I think the best example right now is [Game Objects](/docs/guides/game_objects/).
</Info>

Hey! Before starting, let's stand this guide is just for the one wondering to
contribute with **KAPLAY Docs**, specifically the **guides** part. Thanks for your interest on improving **KAPLAY** â™¥

## Get the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay-site.git
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Then, when you finish, just [Open a PR](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/).

## Guidelines

### Communication

The most important thing for creating a guide is the communication with KAPLAY
Dev internals, you can use the [#dev](https://discord.com/channels/883781994583056384/883782527809122367) channel,
telling us what guide are you updating (so no other dev interfers with that) or any other question/blocker you got.

### Creating your guide

After cloning the repo, go to  `/guides/en/` and create in any of the category
folders an `.mdx` file, for example `/guides/en/concepts/anchor.mdx`.

This is the frontmatter used in all guides:

```yml
---
title: Creating Guides # The title, it appears in the sidebar
description: You shouldn't see this # Description for metadata
version: "4000" # Don't use it unless the guide is only for v4000
url: contributor-guide-on-guides # The url
order: "misc-4" # The order string, just follow the others in the same category
hidden: true # Hide it
noads: true # Disable ads (used in Contributors pages)
---
```

You can know available categories just looking the folders inside `/guides/` or `/guides/data.json`.

### Writing style

There's little things you've to take in account in the writing style

- **Main Title** should be the same than frontmatter `title`.
- Talk to the user as **you**. Instead of "we can use `get()` for..." do "you can use `get()`" for
- Try to do descriptive titles, instead of **Introduction** -> **How to X** / **Creating X**

#### "X Operations" or "How To" collection sections

Some guides include many **How to** section under a "X Operations" section, as a complement of main content, check for example
[Game Object](/docs/guides/game_objects) guide, we could standarize this format:

```mdx
## [Title of Guide] Operations 

### How to [thing]

You can do [thing] with [thing they can use]
```

<Info title="Don't make them the whole thing!" crew="bobo">
Remember, these sections shouldn't replace the main content of the guide but give some common
questions with their responses, another good exmaple is [Tags](/docs/guides/tags) guide, first it introduces
what is a tag, how to use them, and then the operations.

## Components and features in Markdown
