# Migrating from Kaboom.js to KAPLAY

KAPLAY is the fork of Kaboom.js, with the goal of continuing the development of
the library.

This guide is in general, how to pass from Kaboom to KAPLAY.

## Updating the package

As KAPLAY is a fork of Kaboom, you can update the package in your project to
`kaplay` and everything should work as before.

```sh
npm install kaplay@3001
```

```js
// before:
import kaboom from "kaboom";

// after:
import kaboom from "kaplay";
```

### CDN

```js
// before:
import kaboom from "https://unpkg.com/kaboom@3000.1.17/dist/kaboom.mjs";

// after:
import kaboom from "https://unpkg.com/kaplay@3000.1.17/dist/kaboom.mjs";
```
