# Optimization Tips

Here's some tips on optimizing performance / maintainability for KAPLAY games

## Choose a collision detection algorithm which fits your game

There is no perfect collision detection algorithm, which one is better depends 
on the kind of game you are creating. A side-scroller works best with "sap" or
Sweep-and-Prune. A vertical shooter does best with "sapv", a vertical version
of Sweep-and-Prune. For a game which spans both directions, like a top down
strategy game for example, it depends whether the screen is uniformly filled
or if objects are clumped together in some areas. For the former you best use
"grid" which is a hash grid, while the latter does better with "quadtree",
which is exactly that.
These are all broad-phase collisions detection algorithms, which do the first
selection. You can also specify the narrow-phase algorithm, which does the
more precise collision detection. Default is "gjk", or Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi,
which supports both polygon and curved surfaces. If you don't need circles or
other curved shapes, you can use "sat" or Separating Axis Theorem, which only
supports polygons. Lastly there is the simple "box", which implements collision
using Minkowski difference, and only works with AABB or axis aligned bounding
boxes.

## Game Object is not always the answer

Game objects are great for managing game entities, but they have a cost. If you
are only rendering a static image, or a simple shape, you can use `onDraw` with
`drawSprite` or `drawRect` instead of creating a game object.

```js
// create a game object
const player = k.add([
    k.sprite("bean"),
    k.pos(100, 200),
    k.scale(4),
    k.opacity(0.5),
]);

// draw a sprite directly
k.onDraw(() => {
    k.drawSprite({
        sprite: "bean",
        pos: k.vec2(100, 200),
    });
});
```

If you're creating and destroying objects in an absurd rate, you should find
another solution.

- Particles: `particles()` component instead of creating and destroying objects
  for each particle.
- Rendering: `onDraw` for rendering static images or shapes.
- Text: `text()` or `drawText()` transform instead of creating a game object for
  each letter/word.
- Data: `const gameData = {}` for storing game state instead of creating a game
  object the state.

## Cleanup One-off Objects

Sometimes there are some objects that gets created, leaves screen, and never
seen again, like a bullet. These objects will keep being rendered / updated and
be detrimental to performance if they get created a lot, it's better to remove
them when they leave screen.

`offscreen()` is a component that helps you define behavior when objects go
off-screen.

```js
k.add([
    k.sprite("bullet"),
    k.pos(player.pos),
    // the bullet move left forever
    k.move(LEFT, 600),
    // destroy the bullet when it's far out of view
    k.offscreen({ destroy: true }),
]);
```

## Hide Off-Screen Objects

Sometimes you might be drawing a lot of objects that's not on screen (e.g. if
you have a big map and your camera only sees a small area), this is very
unnecessary, use `offscreen()` component to define object's behavior when
they're not on screen.

```js
// planting flowers all over the map
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    k.add([
        k.sprite("flower"),
        k.pos(k.rand(-5000, 5000), k.rand(-5000, 5000)),
        // don't draw or update the flower when they're out of view
        k.offscreen({ hide: true, pause: true }),
    ]);
}
```

## Avoid Global Namespace

By default KAPLAY uses a lot of common names like `pos`, `sprite` that occupies
global namespace, it's often better to use `KAPLAYOpt.global` in `false` to not export KAPLAY
functions to `window`

```js
const k = kaplay({
    global: false,
});

const pos = k.vec2(120, 200);
```

<Info
    crew="bobo"
    title="Browsers replace the global namespace whenever they feel like it.">
Another reason for avoid global namespace is that browsers can patch global
namespace with their own functions, which can cause conflicts with KAPLAY
functions. That happened with `pathfinder()` component in the past, it was `navigate()`.

## Compress Assets

Loading assets takes time, compress them when you can.

- Compress `.ttf` or `.otf` to `.woff2` (with
  [google/woff2](https://github.com/google/woff2))
- Compress `.wav` files to `.ogg` or `.mp3`

## Use Game Object local timers

When programming timer / tween behavior for a specific game object, it's better
to attach `timer()` component to the game object and use that instead of global
timer functions. This way the timer is tied to the life cycle of the game
object, when the game object pauses or gets destroyed, the timer will not run.

```js
// prefer
const player = k.add([
    k.sprite("bean"),
    k.pos(100, 200),
    k.timer(),
    k.state("idle"),
]);

// these timers will only run when player game object is not paused / destroyed
player.wait(2, () => {
    // ...
});

await player.tween(
    player.pos,
    k.mousePos(),
    0.5,
    (p) => (player.pos = p),
    k.easings.easeOutQuad,
);

// this will pause all the timer events
player.paused = true;

// this will stop all the timer events
player.destroy();

player.onStateEnter("attack", async () => {
    // ... state code
    // if we use global k.wait() here it'll create infinitely running state transitions even when player game object doesn't exist anymore
    await player.wait(2);
    player.enterState("idle");
});

player.onStateEnter("idle", async () => {
    // ... state code
    // if we use global k.wait() here it'll create infinitely running state transitions even when player game object doesn't exist anymore
    await player.wait(1);
    player.enterState("attack");
});
```

## Use Game Object local input handlers

Similar to above, it's often better to use local input handlers as opposed to
global ones.

```js
const gameScene = k.add([]);

const player = gameScene.add([
    k.sprite("bean"),
    k.pos(100, 200),
    k.area(),
    k.body(),
]);

// these
gameScene.onKeyPress("space", () => {
    player.jump();
});

// this will pause all the input events
gameScene.paused = true;

// this will stop all the input events
gameScene.destroy();
```
