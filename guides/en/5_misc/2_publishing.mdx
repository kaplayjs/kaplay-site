# Publishing a KAPLAY game

When we finish our game, the most important moment is to... Publish it!

## Preparing the game

We should prepare our game to pubish in the different platforms.

### Assets and source code

The first thing you should know it's both your `public` and `dist` folders (or
whatever they are called) should be the same folder. We recommend having a file
tree like:

```
game/
┣ public/
┃ ┣ sprites/
┃ ┣ sounds/
┃ ┣ index.html - Your bundled index.html file
┃ ┣ game.js - Your bundled game file
```

This way, when you zip `public`, you will have all your assets and code files in
the same folder. This is usually the folder you upload to game platforms like
**Itch.io** and **Newgrounds.com**.

If you use `create-kaplay` template, you start with `public` dir by by default.
</Info>

### Asset paths

When you host your games in web portals, you should use _relative paths_

Actually you may have something like this:

```js
loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png");
```

There's two ways to handle this:

- Update all your imports to start with `./`
- Use `loadRoot()`

`loadRoot()` inserts what it's passed at start of every url:

```js
loadRoot("."); // will add "." at start of every url

loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png"); // -> ./sprites/bean.png
```

<Info crew="bean" title="Watch out!">
Your `loadRoot()` depends of how your urls are. Maybe using `loadRoot("./")` *is a better option*
</Info>

```js
loadRoot("./"); // will add "./" at start of every url

loadSprite("bean", "sprites/bean.png"); // -> ./sprites/bean.png
```

## Itch.io

First, go to your account, then **Upload a new project**

Then, in **Kind of project**, you should select **HTML**, so itch.io will let
you upload a web game

After that, the only thing left to do is to upload your zip with your game
files, or if you have a single `index.html` file (very tasteful) upload it!

## Newgrounds.com

First, go to the up arrow and select Game

Now, as Itch.io, only upload a zip with your fabulous `index.html` game file.

You can tag your game in the different platforms with the tag `kaplayjs` and

`kaplay`. Probably we will see it and even promote in our social medias :D
