    import kaplay from "https://unpkg.com/kaplay@${version}/dist/kaboom.mjs";

    // start kaplay

    kaplay();

# Installation

The most easy way to get started with KAPLAY is to use the [CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-kaplay), which will generate a project for you:

```sh
$ npx create-kaplay mygame
$ cd mygame
$ npm run dev
```

This will create your game in the `mygame` directory, and start a development server for you to preview your game. If you edit `src/main.js` and refresh the page, you will see your changes.

To see all options, run:

```sh
$ create-kaplay --help
```

## Using a CDN

If you prefer to use KAPLAY without any bundlers, you can use a CDN to include it directly in your HTML file,
or import it with ECMAScript modules.

<Code code={ecmaImport} lang="html" />

You can also just include it with a `<script>` tag.

<Code code={jsImport} lang="html" />

## Setup your own Node.js environment

With Node.js and npm it's easier have some other packages and use version control, also it's easier to get typescript autocomplete support, but it requires a bit more setup. (This is the way of `create-kaplay`)

```sh
$ npm install kaplay
```

You'll need to use a bundler to use Kaboom with NPM. There's a lot of options like:

- `esbuild`,
- `webpack`,
- `parcel`,
- `vitejs`,

This is a short example of how to use Kaboom with ["esbuild"](https://esbuild.github.io/).

Once you have `esbuild` installed, and you have this in a `.js` or `.ts` file:

```js
import kaplay from "kaplay";

kaplay();
```

just run

```sh
$ esbuild game.js --bundle > build.js
```

and it'll find the KAPLAY package and include it in the built `build.js`, include `build.js` in your HTML and you're good to go. Feel free to automate this process.

## Loading Assets

You might have encountered errors when trying to `loadSprite()` from local file system, that is because browser won't allow loading local files with JavaScript. To get around that you'll need to use a static file that serves the files through HTTP. There're a lot of programs that helps you to do that.

- `$ python3 -m http.server` if you have [python3](https://www.python.org) installed
- `$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer` if you have [python2](https://www.python.org) installed
- `$ serve` if you have [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) installed
- `$ caddy file-server` if you have [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) installed
- `$ static-here` if you have [static-here](https://github.com/amasad/static-here) installed

Let's say you have a folder structure like this:

```sh
.
├── sprites
│   ├── froggy.png
│   └── cloud.png
├── sounds
│   └── horse.mp3
└── index.html
```

and you have the static file server running on port `8000`, just go to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`, and you should be able to load stuff from relative paths like

```js
loadSprite("froggy", "sprites/froggy.png");
loadSound("horse", "sounds/horse.mp3");
```
