# How to be a Bean Wizard

> If you are reading this, you have been tricked by the promise of magic and
fantasy (blame the person who selected the book title). Instead, your gruesome
journey towards becoming a true game developer has started. 

> Within these pages you will discover the reasons why you should have paid attention during you math
classes instead of doodling or falling asleep. The blame for this inattention
can of course be partially placed on your math teacher, who possibly didn't
understand math good enough to come to the conclusion that math is everything
and everything is math. Games are math, and without having a good enough grip on
it to tame it, you will only be able to create a game which "kind of works",
lacking the performance and grace of a true polished work of art. But fear not,
math is not difficult once truly understood. Like language, it doesn't need
(much) memorization, since everything follows naturally from simple concepts.
All math mentioned here has practical uses in game development and is
illustrated using examples from possible games. Now, you should get started. You
can begin with any topic you like, as it is all connected, there is no beginning
as there is no end.
