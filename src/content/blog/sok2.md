# State of KAPLAY #2

> lajbel, September 2, 2024

Hey! Welcome to State of KAPLAY in their second edition. Quite some time passed
between the previous state and this one. From now all States of KAPLAY will be
published on the 2nd of every month. Time to start with the news.

## When will the next version of KAPLAY be Released?

We are working on two versions currently, **v4000** will be the release with
most features, breaking changes and best improvements, while **v3001** is the
most compatible version with Kaboom.js and also previous tutorials will work
with this version.

## Releasing dates

We got some dates, but we can tell you that the beta of **v3001** will be out on
**September 7th**, the World Beard day. This is the first step to have our first
stable version, while **v4000** is getting the most awaited features.

## KAPLAY Crew: Our wiki

We released the KAPLAY Crew, which our portal of assets, characters and all
related to the KAWord (KAPLAY World). It works as an assets browser (if you want
to download them) and also as a wiki for our lore lovers.
