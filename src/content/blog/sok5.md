# State of KAPLAY #5

> lajbel, FRIDAY 13th (‚ò†Ô∏è) of June, 2025, from KAPLAY HQ

Hey! Now, it's the time to talk about **KAPLAY**, the things we did, the things we're going to do and all stuff related to the **KAWorld** (or even, KA-_Universe_). Again, I've sub estimated how much stuff I have to document on this process, so this blog is charged _**with a lot of content**_, please, enjoy your reading.

## ‚ú® Balance of World...

> Team Update

Our Team is composed of _wonderful persons_, you probably knew two:

- **MF** represents the **Wisdom** for take the right decision inside the repository.
- **lajbel** represents the **Power** of ~~breaking~~ production and create new awesome products.

But something was missing, the **Courage** of create something new, wonderful, something _different_...

_wait for it_

**Misanthrope!** Also known as **Imaginarny**, but now also known as **THE HERO**, has joined to the **KAPLAY Team**, as the 3rd member of the team, he's here as the **Courage**!

_Now, the KAPLAY Triforce is complete!_

As one of the KAPLAY founders, I'm so happy having him working along with us, is not only a new team member, for me, also a friend. Now, he is our **official** designer, so all the eggcellents UI/UX you're going to see, comes from his hand.

## üß∞ Where my last project was...?

> Product Update

And right after that **EPIC** introduction, will get into a ‚ú® P R O D U C T U P D A T E ‚ú® (_I don't know how to write these blogs, help me_).

**KAPLAYGROUND** has evolved not only as a Playground, but also as a full-featured Editor. Now, we're introducing the **2.2** and **2.3**!

In **2.2**, we give you the **New Project Browser**. You can do _everything_ with it: **Filter** your projects, get into different **difficulties**, see your saved projects and all with a nicer UX/UI binged by our **Courage**.

Now, in **2.3** you're receiving a lot of _Quality of Life_ updates and new code integrations, like auto-complete for components inside add() statements.

Next, in **2.4**, we will be adding:

- _Version Filter_: Filter demos and projects using specific KAPLAY versions.
- _ESBuild_: Playground works just as your local project does, so features like import/export and bundle code optimization will be possible now!

## üñ•Ô∏è 20 changelogs

> Product Update

Okay okay this thing of KAPLAYGROUND is so good but, what's going on with KAPLAY? There's a lot of stuff to say about it's development, so will take on with the ‚ú® _H I G H L I G T H E D_ ‚ú® features that are coming now to **v4000** alphas:

- **Systems API**: Replace system-core KAPLAY features (like Physics) and put their own.
- **Global Layering:** Layers now work globally - [#736](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/736) - Example
- **Picture API:** Optimize many draw calls in one with `drawPicture()` - [#650](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/650) - [Example](https://play.kaplayjs.com/?example=picture&version=4000.0.0-alpha.19)
- **Parent options:** Choose want to keep and want to drop when changing an object's parent, in the `obj.setParent` API - [#562](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/562)
- **A lot of text-related improvements**: [#676](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/676), [#687](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/687), [#691](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/691). (Special thanks to dragoncoder047)
- **Improvements in rendering**: [#760](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/760)

In general lines, that were the most important changes, but there **was a lot** and also a lot of bug fixes. You can see them all [here](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pulls?q=is%3Apr+created%3A%3E2025-02-28+is%3Aclosed).

**KAPLAY v4000** is closer than never, maybe we can even get a beta soon, but now the hardest part left, _change-logging and documenting_ (üò•).

## ‚õèÔ∏è In the cubes KAWorld...

> Minecraft Server

Okay, maybe your brain is already tired of reading this (and _of_ **me** ~~_**overusing**_~~ **text_styles**). Will talk about something fun. In the KAPLAY Minecraft Server:

Thanks to Misa, we reopened our Minecraft Server, so yeah, you can join and play again! Maybe you even found me or Misa playing.

But nothing... _**nothing**_ can be perfect, right? There's a problematic we should talk about... **Genocide of the iron Golems**, done by a person who I considered a _friend_... If you care about Iron Golems life, I recommend you checking [savethegolems.org](https://savethegolems.org).

### üëæ KAPLAYWare, our special highlighted game

From **AmySparkNG**, Clickery Hexagon creator (and if you haven't played it, check our section about it in [State of KAPLAY #2](https://kaplayjs.com/blog/sok2/)) is developing a new game called **KAPLAYWare** (**kaplayware** or **KAPLAYWARE** is also acceptable).

It's like Wario-Ware, but with KAPLAY and also it's own "_engine_" built in top of KAPLAY.

## ü¶ä HAPPY FONT!

> Product Update

WOO! The classic KAPLAY defaulty font **happy** got a redesign with a bunch of changes on it's **2.0** version, but the main one is now it's available in **.TTF** format, so you can use it in your notepad, your code-editor, terminal or even in your calculator (doubt it).

It is **AVAILABLE NOW** on Itch.io:

## üì´ The State of The State of KAPLAY

> The State of The State of The State of KAPLAY

So okay, we're reaching the end to the **MAGNIFIC** State of KAPLAY, the fifth edition. But now, what to expect on the next weeks? I'm not doing a State of KAPLAY every month (I never did, but now I'm realistic).

From now on State of KAPLAY will be held when we get **important updates**. I want to make state really **interesting** for reading and also having fun as everything we do inside KAPLAY.

> However, I would say next one will be not with that big lap like we got in between #4 and #5. Don't expect it being this big anyway xD

By the way, I opened the [`üì´-sok-dump`](https://discord.gg/nrApn8rZ6h) channel in our **‚ú® A W E S O M E ‚ú®** Discord Server, so you can send there what you would like to be in the next **SOK** (üß¶) edition :D

Saying that, I go to go. Bye, thanks for reading and have a nice day.
