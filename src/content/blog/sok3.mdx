# State of KAPLAY #3

> lajbel, 2nd of October, 2024 - Writing from Ghosty's house

Hey KAPLAYERS! How are you? Welcome to The State of KAPLAY #3, the blog where we
talk about KAPLAY. And yes, I'm keeping my promise reality publishing this blog
2 of October.

## KAPLAY Updates, what devs are cooking? üßë‚Äçüç≥

Okay, what are we cooking on KAPLAY? Our math expert **MF** is working on many
performance improvements for **v4000**. Actually he has a branch where he
improved the processing of game objects in general, at the point where our
_bench.js_ example with 5000 game objects with `[sprite(), pos()]` passed from
**25 to 60fps** on Chromium.

I'm working on optimizations on our Texture Packer, so you can remove sprites
from memory, to save resources in larger games. Also, I'm redoing many examples
so they are up-to-date and more intuitive.

These PRs will be very important and bring KAPLAY v4000 one step closer.

Other things includes bug fixes, collisions adjustments and more. We released
two versions, **v4000.0.0-alpha.5** and **v3001.0.0-beta.3**. Here's the
[changelog](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/releases/tag/3001.0.0-beta.2).

From here, thanks to all our contributors, specially to _dragoncoder047_,
_niceEli_ and _imaginarny_. Thanks for your contributions!

## KAPLAY touching grass in an event

KAPLAY Recently went to the **FIJA** (_International Feria of Argentinian
Videogames_, me and my official team helper, _Jairo_, went to represent KAPLAY.
We presented KAPLAY to many people, gifted stickers and also gave away some
pins. From here, thanks to [Himu](https://himu.ar) for give us **his half of a
stand** THANK YOU SO MUCH.

Here are some pictures of the **FIJA**:

Thanks to everyone who came, I haven't seen any community member but many people
interesting on become a true KAPLAYER.

## KAPLAYGROUND v2, spoilers

The thing I'm working on most is KAPLAYGROUND v2, it comes with a lot of new
features

- Multi-file editing
- Two modes, project & examples, with classic KAPLAYGROUND experience
- Importing assets and saving them
- Project & Examples browsing
- Some cool editor integrations like seeing previews of `loadXXXX` funcs, or
  load assets from a Context Menu instead of writing them manually.

I don't have a date for it at the moment, but probably coming this month. You
can also try [this preview version](https://new-editor.kaplay.pages.dev/)

[niceEli](https://niceeli.tech/), he setup a Minecraft server for us, where you
can play with your friends, build stuff and show your beans. Here's a picture of

KAPLAY soon. Maybe a release this month...? Yes, that, KAPLAY v3001 date will be
