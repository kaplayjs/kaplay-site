# KAPLAY v4000 Alpha 23

> lajbel, 11/5/2025, from the inside of the Pumpka

Hey! lajbel here. Let me introduce you to the next version of KAPLAY, the alpha 23. Before
getting into all the new features, let's see how to install it:

```bash
npm install kaplay@4000.0.0-alpha.23
```

## Lifetime Scopes

The first thing I would like to introduce is the **Lifetime Scopes** feature.
Before, it was impossible to have event handlers that wouldn't be destroyed in scene change,
now it is! There are three scopes:

- `app`: These event handlers are not canceled automatically.
- `scene`: These event handlers are canceled on scene change. (Note that now you can access `scene` as an object, also still use `scene()`)
- `obj`: These event handlers need to be used with an object (`obj = add([])`) and them are canceled on object destroy

The list of supported handlers is in the type `GameEventHandlers`.

Let's see this quick example:

<Code code={`
kaplay({
    defaultLifetimeScope: "scene", // "scene" is default
});

loadBean();

app.onKeyPress("a", () => {
    debug.log("I run until cancelled");
});

scene("bean", () => {
    const obj = add([ sprite("bean") ]);

    obj.onKeyPress("o", () => {
        debug.log("I run until obj get destroyed");
        obj.destroy();
    });

    scene.onKeyPress("s", () => { // or just onUpdate(() => {
        debug.log("I run until scene is changed", "current scene is bean");
        go("rice");
    });
});

scene("rice", () => {
    scene.onKeyPress("s", () => { // or just onUpdate(() => {
        debug.log("I run until scene is changed", "current scene is rice");
    });
});

go("bean");
`}
/>

More explanations will come in a future guide, as it is a quite big feature.

## The skew property in Text Transformation 

Now in the Text Transformation API (`TextCompOpt.styles`) you can use the `skew` property, let's see an example
creating text italics:

<Code code={`
kaplay({ background: "black" });

add([
    pos(100, 100),
    text(
        "oh [i]hi[/i]",
        {
            styles: {
                i: {
                    skew: 20,
                },
            },
        },
    ),
]);

`}
/>

## Little perfomance improvements

If you were using `maxFps` you may get better perfomance with this version due to
some bug fixes related to this.

So, that's all for this version, next version will include **UI** and **Hover Refactor**,
we'll talk more about it in the next release. Thank you, I leave you with the changelog.
