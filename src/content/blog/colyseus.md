# KAPLAY x Colyseus

> lajbel, march 27 of 2025, from the coliseum

Hey! I'm writing this blog so all you know that the first **Integration guide**
is out, **KAPLAY x Colyseus**.

Our friends at Colyseus have been one of KAPLAY's **most important donors**,
making things like our recent rebranding, and much more, possible. Without
Colyseus, KAPLAY would be **far away** from where we are today.

That's why one of our community members (_our designer undercover agent_),
**Misanthrope** (imaginarny @GitHub) made this AWESOME and COMPLETE guide about
making a game using KAPLAY and Colyseus.

There is not much I can add to explain the epicness of this guide, just look at
it. Thanks to Misanthrope for making this amazing blog and Endel from Colyseus
for collab with us all this time.
