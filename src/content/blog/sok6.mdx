# State of KAPLAY #6

> _lajbel_, 24/08/2025, Direct from the KAPLAY Basement

Hey! Welcome to the act of reading the **State of KAPLAY #6**, the kinda bi-monthly **blog** about the current **state** of **KAPLAY**, on it's **6th** edition!

I've prepared for you a _**lot**_ (‚ò†Ô∏è) of product updates, events, and surprises for this month, and a *very special announcement* about the near future of KAPLAY Library.
## Revamped KAPLAY API Docs ‚ú®

<span class="head-badge">Product Update</span>

We published a _lot_ of **‚ú® U P D A T E S ‚ú®** (updates) in KAPLAY Website and specially, in **documentation** for making KAPLAY learning _stronger_ and _easier_. We present to you the versions **v1.2**, **v1.3**, and **v1.4**! (**WHOA!**)

Version **1.2** was mainly a rewrite in our **rendering** API docs workflow. Now it's most accurate in rendering types, and they look better. Also, now you can click on anchors for link to specific members.

In the other side, **v1.3** landed some design and structure improvements. Now all links related to docs are prefixed with `/docs/`, being the two main categories `/docs/guides` and `/docs/api`. Also, there's a new [**special introduction**](https://kaplayjs.com/docs/api/) in API Docs.

Finally, in **1.4+** we're shipping one of the greatest **Quality of Life** features, the new **Docs Preview** window!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xk7cwcZ.gif)

The main objective of all these feature was improving general experience for new learners. I hope it helps both for new and old users.

## OK but our guides üìï

Our guides also needed some love, so we added **Playable Examples**, now you can open the examples present in guides directly in the **KAPLAYGROUND**. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/7a00pJ8.png)

These playable examples are available in guides like **Basic Concepts** and **Game Objects**, but we have to do an overall guides improvements, and if you're wondering to contribute in KAPLAY, there's a new [**Guide about creating guides**](kaplayjs.com/docs/guides/contributor-guide-on-guides/)!

We've added API Docs linking too, where *special words* like `add()` or `sprite()` are converted in links to the KAPLAY API Docs, **great**! [Check KAPLAY Site changelog](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay-site/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see all the things we shipped.
## Prefabs ü§ñ

<span class="head-badge">Product Update</span>

One of the most requested features in KAPLAY, since beginning (and specially since [`make` was doomed](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/666)), was component serialization and **prefabs**, and we added it:

```js
const bean = add([
    sprite("bean"),
    pos(20, 20),
    "gamer",
]);

// Get the serialized data in an object
const beanPrefab = createPrefab(bean);

// Register it as an asset
createPrefab("bean", bean);
```

Now, `beanPrefab` is a prefab, it contains serialized data of components and tags for it's recreation later:

```js
addPrefab(beanPrefab); // Use the serialized object 
addPrefab("bean"); // Use the registered asset
```

This awesome feature is still on experimental phase, so I hope many of you try it. Not all components got serialization methods yet, we'll add it progressively.
## Lajbubu üì∏

<span class="head-badge">Remember to remove this ok?</span>

![](https://i.imgur.com/TWyZOFj.png)

**Laj**bubu, now lajbel is a labubu! *I just hope the internet gets deleted soon*.

## KAPLAY v4000 ü¶ñ

KAPLAY v4000 It's been in development for **over a year**, so it's normal that many of you asked *When it's going to be released?*

I am pleased to tell you that **the next KAPLAY blog** **will be** **totally focused on v4000 stuff**, from changelogs, breaking changes, new features and even release dates. So, I'll have to tell you to wait a little longer, but the wait will be worth it. 

Anyway, I encourage you checking [KAPLAY Changelog](https://v4000.kaplayjs.com/changelog/) for get a good brief of all what's coming.

## Literally the KAPLAY IDE üñ•Ô∏è

The feature set available in **KAPLAYGROUND v2.4** is sick, you will see the first surprise just opening it, but I'm not going to spoiler it here because it's so cool guys just open it before continue reading this text...

**...**

Haven't you done it yet?

**...**

Okay, you want the link? Then find it.

[**...**](https://play.kaplayjs.com/)

Well now I hope all of you have already opened it. Yes, the first feature is the new **Welcome Screen**, looks so pretty, pretty, pretty, and beautiful.

But that's not all, the main feature I want introduce to you are the new **Build Mode**, we've integrated **ESBuild** as the under-the-hood KAPLAYGROUND bundler.

This, means that your code in new **v2.4** projects will work with **import/export** syntax resolve. This introduces an experience more similar to how they work locally, and the possibility of supporting **TypeScript** and NPM Packages soon‚Ñ¢.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SkL9YQ8.gif)


Projects created before **v2.4** will be using the **Legacy Build Mode**, which uses our code merge process, and it depends on the file order, read more about it in the [KAPLAYGROUND wiki](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplayground/wiki/How-Legacy-Build-Mode-works).

In addition, the new **Project Preferences Menu** add you the possibility to modify your exported game favicon, and some other features like the **Build Mode**, cool if you want to upgrade an old project.

## Crew is watching you üëÅÔ∏è

<span class="head-badge">Product Update</span>

We started with **Crew v2** in March of this year, and after a lot of iterations, modifications, new ideas and many other work suddenly appearing, we can showcase you the **new Crew plugin:**

```sh
npm i @kaplayjs/crew
```

```js
import kaplay from "kaplay";
import { crew } from "@kaplayjs/crew";

kaplay({
	plugins: [crew],
});

loadCrew("sprite", "mark");
loadCrew("sound", "burp");

add([
	sprite("mark"),
]);

play("burp");
```

And that simple you can start using the Crew assets in your KAPLAY games, the crew plugin is available since: [**NOW**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kaplayjs/crew).

But, that's not all! As part of **KAPLAY Site v1.5**, with you, the new **Crew Browser**:

![](https://i.imgur.com/12BaawH.gif)

A lot of **ways** to categorize the assets:

- Type: Sprite, UI, Sounds
- Category: KAWorld, Icons, Emojis, etc
- Tags: Animals, Brand, Fonts, Food
- Origin: Official, Community, or Commission

But that's not all, new information was added to Assets, like its **apparitions**, **birthdays**, and a lot of cool information of your **favorite characters**, so remember say "Happy Birthday" to Bean on 01/01 :D

![](https://i.imgur.com/ucF7Hbw.gif)

This is my *favorite* thing of all this blog, really, just go to the [Crew website](https://kaplayjs.com/crew/) and take a look around all the stuff, you will found a lot of fun things. This is a gift for all KAPLAY fans. 

There was a lot, a lot of more changes that I couldn't put all of them on this blog so check out the [KAPLAY Crew changelog](https://github.com/kaplayjs/crew/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
