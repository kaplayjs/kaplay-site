# State of KAPLAY #1

> lajbel, July 15, 2024

Hey everyone! It's been a while since our last update. A lot has been happening
in the world of KAPLAY/Kaboom.js, so let's dive into what's new.

## New Journey, from Kaboom.js to KAPLAY, Thanks Kaboom.js Community!

If you don't know, Kaboom.js was a game library for making games in the browser.
It was deprecated and now we have KAPLAY, a fork of Kaboom.js with new features,
fixes and community support.

We are working in `v3001`, why not **4000**? Because we want to add new features
and fix bugs without breaking the API. The idea is to have atleast a _99.99%_ of
games made with Kaboom.js **v3000** working in KAPLAY **v3001**.

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the original Kaboom.js community, now the
thriving KAPLAY community. Special thanks go to:

-   **tga**, original creator of Kaboom.js. Thanks for creating this amazing
    library.
-   **MF**, for being a great contributor in Kaboom.js and also in KAPLAY, doing
    all the engineer work.
-   **niceEli**, for being a great contributor in CI and also being active in the
    community.
-   **AmySpark**, who contributed to the code and also is active in the
    community.
-   **neverUsedDC**, for being a contributor in the code and also is active in the
    community.
-   **SpcFork**, for being a contributor in the code and also is active in the
    community.
-   **Haroon**, for being moderator of the Discord server and also is active in the
    community.
-   **Shoozza**, for being a contributor in the code.
-   **JSLegendDev**, for creating content about KAPLAY.
-   **Gamedev.js**, for creating a [post](https://gamedevjs.com/tools/kaplay/)
    about KAPLAY.
-   And all the other **contributors** and **community members**.

These individuals have been instrumental in transitioning from Kaboom.js to
KAPLAY and continuing to drive the library forward.

## New features

From the creation of KAPLAY, to today, the alpha number 17, the team and
contributors have been working hard to bring **new features and improvements**
to the library.

-   **Input bindings**, use the same event `onButtonPress` for mouse, keyboard
    and gamepad.
-   **Layers**, backing from the void.
-   Navigation Mesh, waypoints, patrols, sentries, and more in the **pathfinding
    system**.
-   **Particles system**, finally.
-   Utils for colors, arrays, etc such as `Color.toArray()`, `shuffle()`, etc.
-   Support for new shapes and drawing as textured polygons.
-   Added support for **gravity directions** (inverting gravity??)
-   and a lot more!

Check all current changes in the [CHANGELOG](/changelog).

In the code side, we had

-   [Big Refactor PR](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/258) of more than
    7000 line changes, that will make the codebase more organized and clean,
    improving our DX.
-   [Strict TypeScript PR](https://github.com/kaplayjs/kaplay/pull/232), that
    passed all the codebase to Strict TypeScript, to avoid bugs and have a
    better development experience.

Thanks to all our contributors, we are growing and improving the library.

## New website and documentation

With the project migration, the website also changed. This version of the
website has the API documentation splitted in various pages, to load faster and
be more organized.

Also searchbars were added to the documentation and blog, so you can find
content faster.

## Asset Brew

We added the asset brew, a UI to get all KAPLAY Friends imported in your
[KAPLAYGROUND](https://play.kaplayjs.com) project.

(Secret: Hovering the asset will show you a description about it, know more
about the KAPLAY Lore)

## Collective funding

We are now in [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/kaplay), a platform
where you can support the project with donations and sponsorships.

The funds will be used for paying the team, maintaining the project and for prizes in game
jams. Open Collective is fully transparent, you can see how the funds are being
used.
