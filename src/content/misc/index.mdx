Start playing around with it in the [KAPLAYGROUND](https://kaplayjs.com)

## Features

- **Easy & Fun**: KAPLAY API is easy and fun to use.
- **Designed for Games**: KAPLAY is built from the ground up for making games, not only render graphics.
- **Library**: KAPLAY is a library, not a framework. You can use as much or as little of it as you like.

## KAPLAY vs Kaboom.js, what's the difference?

On 21 May 2024 we took the decision to create this spiritual successor of kaboom, being also a fork of it.

This was due to Kaboom.js being abandoned by Replit, the original creator of Kaboom.js, and the community was left without a maintainer.

The idea is to expand what kaboom was under a new identity, kaplay itself is fully compatible with Kaboom.
