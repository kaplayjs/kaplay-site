# Videos

A video can be played using the video component. This can be used for intros, or cut-scenes for example.

## The video component

```ts
const intro = add([
    pos(200, 100), // Where to place the video
    video("intro.mp4"),
]);

intro.play();
```

## Play, pause, rewind

The video doesn't automatically start playing, for that `intro.start()` needs to be called. To pause the video there is `intro.pause()`. If you want stop functionality, you can call `intro.pause()` and set `intro.currentTime` to 0.

## Play position

The play position, aka `intro/currentTime`, can be get and set. The relative position can be computed by dividing by `intro.duration`.
