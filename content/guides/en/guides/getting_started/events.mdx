# Events

An **Event** is something that _happens_ in the game, for example, the player
pressing a key, clicking the mouse or an enemy being hurt.

An **Event Handler** is a method that listens for events and run code when they
happen. These functions are named as `on{EventName}`.

```js
// onKeyPress() will run every time user press any key
onKeyPress((key) => {
    // Some events send you args related to them, in this case the key pressed
    debug.log(key); // will log the key pressed
});
```

**Event Handlers** also return an **Event Controller**. It works for cancel the
event or pause it:

```js
const pressEvent = onKeyPress((key) => {
    debug.log(key);
});

pressEvent.cancel(); // stop running the handler
```

There's many type of events that runs in different contexts:

### App events

**App events** run without neccesity of being attached to a game object. They
are related to things like the game screen, input, etc.

```js
// Only runs when the user presses "a"
onKeyPress("a", () => {
    debug.log("aaa");
});

// Only runs when assets finish loading
onLoad(() => {});
```

<Info crew="bobo" title="App events are also in objects">
There's some events like `onKeyPress()` which also have a `obj.onKeyPress()` version. They are still App events but they got removed when the object was destroyed. See the [App Events list](/#app-events-list) below
</Info>

### Root events

**Root events** run during the lifecycle of the **Root Game Object**, or the
same, forever.

```js
// onUpdate() event runs every frame.
onUpdate(() => {
    // Bean moves 10px to the right every frame
    bean.moveBy(10, 0);
});

// onDraw() event runs after update and must be used with drawXXXX functions.
onDraw(() => {
    // The sprite is drawn here to prevent it from disappearing after 1 frame.
    drawSprite("bean");
});
```

You can also associate these event handlers with **Tags**. This means you can
run the event handler code _4 times_ if there's _4 objects_ with that tag. The
**first argument** is always **the game object** it's running for.

```js
// imagine there's 4 objects with tag "friend"

// onUpdate("friend") will be executed 4 times per frame (or the same, 1 time per object)
onUpdate("friend", (o) => {
    // o will take 4 different values
    debug.log(o.id);
});
```

### Game Object events

**Game Object events** are like Root events, but they operate on individual
**Game Objects**. These events run during specific points in the object's
lifecycle, such as when it's added, updated, or removed.

```js
const obj = add([]);

// Runs when the object is added
obj.onAdd(() => {});
// Runs when the object is destroyed
obj.onDestroy(() => {});

// They run while obj exists
obj.onUpdate(() => {});
obj.onDraw(() => {});
```

Both Object and Root events operate with [Object Events List](#object-events-list).

## Game Object events given by components

There are events and events handlers that comes from some components. They
become events of the object after add the comp:

```js
const kat = add([
    // health(initialHp) comp gives to the object a health system
    health(4),
]);

// Given by health(), runs when we hurt the obj
kat.onHurt(() => {
    debug.log("you're a monster!");
});

// Run when user clicks
onMousePress(() => {
    kat.hurt(1); // we remove 1 hp, ouch
});
```

## Generic handler

`on()` is a way to create handlers without they being premade. In fact, all
events handler are an `on()`.

You can use **global** `on()`, it works for use **Game Object events** with
certain tags. The first argument is always the object. It is useful when there's
not a handler for tags, for example in the component events:

```js
// obj.onHurt() but for many objects
on("hurt", "friend", (o) => {
    debug.log(o.id);
});

on("update", "friend", (o) => {
    debug.log(o.id + "exists");
});
```

There's also the object version, `obj.on()`. Useful for listening to an event only
in that obj:

```js
kat.on("hurt", () => {
});
```

## Custom events

Sometimes you will need create a custom event. For this, we use the `on()` and
`obj.trigger()` functions.

```js
// Eat event for all objects with cake tag
on("eat", "cake", () => {
    debug.log("The cake is a lie!");
});

onKeyPress(() => {
    obj.trigger("eat");
});
```

## Events operations

### How to listen for an event

```js
// a global event
onUpdate(() => {});
// an object event
obj.onUpdate(() => {});
// a custom event
obj.on("hi", () => {});
```

### How to trigger an event

```js
// will execute obj.on("hi", () => {})
obj.trigger("hi"); // :>
```
